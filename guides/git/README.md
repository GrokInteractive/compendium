# Our git work-flow

We use `git` for our source code management, and host our repositories on GitHub. 

We follow a work-flow heavy on feature branches. No employee should be forking private repositories from the Grok GitHub to any personal accounts, private or otherwise.

**NOTE:** Do not fork repositories to your private accounts.  All work will be done in feature branches and merged via pull request.
