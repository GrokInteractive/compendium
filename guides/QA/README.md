# Quality Assurance

Grok delivers outstanding software to our clients. We all take pride in the work we do, and internal QA helps our customer get the best product we can offer.

## We are all QA

Despite your job title, we are all members of the QA team. If you see a bug or issue on any project, you should submit an issue on the GitHub repo or Trello board corresponding to that project.

## Mo Info, Mo Betta

The more information you can provide for an issue, the better. Please provide steps necessary to reproduce, screenshots, anything that will help.

#### LiCEcap

Use LiCEcap to capture a screencast as a `.gif`. Great to put in Trello cards, Slack chats, email; really anywhere you need to share a snippet of video.

## Pre-Flight Checklist

The template for our pre-flight checklist can be found on Trello:
