# Communication

## Internal Team Communication

Team members are not always in the same location. As a result, Grok has embraced many forms of communications. Each of these have qualities that make them useful, however, choosing the best tool for the need is required.

### Email

** Priority: Low ** &mdash; < 1 business day response time.

Email is a great for lower priority needs, and should be answered same business day if possible.

Auto-responders while on leave are appreciated.

### Slack

** Priority: Normal ** &mdash; < 30 minute response time.

We use slack for our team chat. Use the `@` character to designate alerts to a channel, individual, or everyone.

For example, `Jason Ellis` has a Slack name of `jason.ellis`, and can be reached via `@jason.ellis`. 

You are encouraged to use Slack on desktop and mobile, and to turn on notifications.

### TEXT/SMS

** Priority: HIGH ** &mdash; < 10 minute response time.

Text messages are reserved for high priority, and should be used sparingly, and usually by the leadership team only.

#### Phone Call

** Priority: UBER ** &mdash; immediate response required.

Unless a production server is down or someone is in danger, this should only be used by both parties agreeing to a call.
