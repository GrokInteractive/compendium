# Time Tracking

At Grok, we use [Harvest](https://www.getharvest.com/) for time tracking.

In addition to their web app, they also have a [Chrome extension and widgets for Mac or PC](https://www.getharvest.com/widget).

## Philosophy

## Tips

* Sometimes Slack's timestamps can come in handy if you forgot to start a timer.

## Open Questions/Issues

* Consistency across projects
* What about when youâ€™re not AT the keyboard but thinking about the project?
* Rounded vs non-rounded?
* What are the basic "buckets" for every project?
* What about bugs/regressions?
