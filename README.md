# Grok Conpendium

This is a collection of documents and software scripts to make working at Grok easier.

This repository serves as our Employee Handbook, onboarding documents, and setup scripts for our staff.

We have chosen to keep this repository public, as we believe transparency to our clients is a vital part in forming partnerships with the teams we build software for.

If you have any questions or concerns, please contact someone at www.grok-interactive.com
