### Geekdom Membership

Fill out an application for Geekdom membership at http://www.geekdom.com/san-antonio/signup-desk. In the comment section, put that you have been hired by and covered by Grok Interactive. Grok Interactive pays for your Geekdom membership. Pretty sweet, huh?

You will need to go in person to Geekdom, at 110 E Houston St., and get a key FOB. You will use this to access the floors that house the Grok office and Geekdom.

### Education Allowance

Here is how the education allowance works: Grok will reimburse you up to $1000 every year for education costs, this includes online classes, tutorials, conferences, or any other educational expense. We do ask that you share your newfound skills with the rest of the team!

When you buy books, Grok Interactive asks that when you finish the book, you either keep the book in the Grok Interactive library, or teach a team member what you learned, or both. You can keep the book as long as you like before putting it in the Grok library.

Fill out your contact information at https://sites.google.com/a/grok-interactive.com/grok-info/.

#### Birthday Week

In addition to the three paid sick days and seven paid personal days you receive each year, Grok offers its employees a floating day off the week of your birthday.

## Policies

Grok strives to be a great place to work. We maintain the following mantra:

> Happy Developers &amp; Happy Clients

Everything we do at Grok should be in our client's and co-worker's best interest. At any point if you believe we are not living up to this standard, please stop what you are doing and let someone know.

### Behavior

Treat everyone (coworkers, clients, passer-bys, anyone) with respect and dignity. If something comes up, give as much notice as possible. Be awesome to one another. That's about it.

![Be excellent to each other](http://media.giphy.com/media/POekkUcKs16gg/giphy.gif)

### Daily Scrum

Every weekday we have a remote Scrum using GoToMeeting. You can use your phone, computer, or tablet to join the meeting.

In the daily Scrum, we go around and each of us talks about what we did the day before, what we are doing that day, and any challenges we have. We like to keep it short &mdash; under 15 minutes if possible. 

### Work hours

Speaking of which, what are the work hours at Grok like? We believe in work-life balance. We avoid working on the weekend if possible. Most employees come in between 9 am and 9:30 am, some come in later and stay later. The number of hours worked is less important than getting your work done done well. Billable time is better than non-billable time. Your weekly goal is 32 hours of client work, and 8 hours of internal or professional growth time.

The Grok business day ends at 6PM CST, and our work week is from Monday through Friday. While it is sometimes necessary to work outside these hours, we expect Grokers to get their work done during the workday and enjoy their nights and weekends.

#### Professional Development Time

If you have completed 32 billable client hours in a week, you are encouraged to use your remaining time to work on professional development.

These activities can include, but are not limited to:

* Internal Products &mdash; Grok continues to develop products for internal and public use. You are encouraged to contribute to these products, or pitch ideas for new ones. See www.elFormo.com and www.Jekyll-Plugins.com as examples.
* Open Source &mdash; Contributing to open source projects, especially ones that Grok uses, is a great way to give back to the community while developing your skills.
* Creating open source projects &mdash; Ruby gems, small projects, POCs, etc
* Blogging &mdash; The Grok Blog does not just write itself. Learn something cool? Build something you want to share? Have a strong opinion you must share with the community? Blog about it and we'll post it!
* Hacking &mdash; Hack away on a problem, build a RaspberryPi project, hack the coffee maker, whatever. Try to keep a focus on the team - do stuff that benefits us all. If you learn something in the process, please share.

### Working remotely

You can work part of your week remotely. We ask that you be in the office at least 50% of your time if possible. We do this because it helps with communication. The rest of the time, work from wherever you wish.

## Using our Software

We aim to keep the number of tools we use to a minimum, and use the best tool for the job. If you have any suggestions of better tooling for our work-flow, we are always open to new ways.

Below you will find links and work-flow for some of the more common applications used at Grok.

### Harvest

We use Harvest for time tracking. You can find our Harvest at https://grokinteractive.harvestapp.com

#### Using Harvest

* Harvest is how we track our time 
* It is a big deal; it is how we earn money
* All tasks should be entered
* It is especially important to record commit messages and hashes in each entry
* Smaller chunks of time are better
* Try to keep chunks of time under two hours
* Do not leave the description field empty
* Keep it concise.

### Trello

Trello is our preferred board for managing our projects.

We use the following columns as a general template

SEE: https://trello.com/b/09QiNnDM/grok-development-template

* Assets &mdash; These are assets for the project. As new ones arrive, we'll put them here.
* Research &mdash; Research and Discovery - items that need more understanding to proceed.
* Backlog &mdash; These are UNAPPROVED items that will be added to TODO lists as needed.
* TODO Backend &mdash; APPROVED tasks ready to be developed.
* TODO Frontend &mdash; APPROVED tasks ready to be developed.
* Doing &mdash; Currently being worked by a developer.
* Pull Request / QA &mdash; Completed cards in code review and QA.
* Staging &mdash; Tasks pushed to Staging server
* Production &mdash; Tasks pushed to Production server

As you work on a card, be sure to assign it to yourself and move to the appropriate column in Trello.

### Slack

We use Slack as our company wide chat system.

To learn more about Slack, please visit https://slack.com/is/team-communication

### GotoMeeting

Download GTM http://support.citrixonline.com/en_US/Meeting/help_files/G2M010002?Title=Download+GoToMeeting

Most of our meetings are conducted via GTM. We will post links in the calendar invites for all meetings.

### GitHub

You will need a GitHub account that will be linked to the Grok organization account. 

### Other Software

#### Text Editor / IDE
Use the text editor of your choice, unless it is emacs :)

#### Screencast

Use Licecap to capture a screencast as a gif. Great to put in trello cards, slack chats, emails, really anywhere you need to share a snippet of video.

#### SSH tunnel

https://ngrok.com/

Use `ngrok` to set up an SSH tunnel to your work in progress on your dev box. This can easily be shared with teammates for collaboration.

### Misc Recommended Software

We recommend using a password manager like LastPass.
